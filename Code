#First, we will important the necessary libraries
!pip install bs4
!pip install requests pandas

#Next, we will import the required modules and functions
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup # this module helps in web scrapping.
import requests  # this module helps us to download a web page

#Consider the following HTML-
%%html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
<h3><b id='boldest'>Lebron James</b></h3>
<p> Salary: $ 92,000,000 </p>
<h3> Stephen Curry</h3>
<p> Salary: $85,000, 000 </p>
<h3> Kevin Durant </h3>
<p> Salary: $73,200, 000</p>
</body>
</html>

#We can store it as a string in the variable HTML:
html="<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>Page Title</title></head><body><h3><b 
id='boldest'>Lebron James</b></h3><p> Salary: $ 92,000,000 </p><h3> Stephen Curry</h3><p> Salary: $85,000, 000 </p><h3> 
Kevin Durant </h3><p> Salary: $73,200, 000</p></body></html>"

#To parse a document, pass it into the BeautifulSoup constructor. 
#The BeautifulSoup object represents the document as a nested data structure:
soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')

#First, the document is converted to Unicode (similar to ASCII) and HTML entities are converted to Unicode characters. 
#Beautiful Soup transforms a complex HTML document into a complex tree of Python objects. 
#The BeautifulSoup object can create other types of objects. 
#In this lab, we will cover BeautifulSoup and Tag objects, that for the purposes of this lab are identical. 
#Finally, we will look at NavigableString objects.

#We can use the method prettify() to display the HTML in the nested structure:
print(soup.prettify())

#Let's say we want the title of the page and the name of the top paid player.
#We can use the Tag. The Tag object corresponds to an HTML tag in the original document, for example, the tag title.
tag_object=soup.title
print("tag object:",tag_object)

#We can see the tag type bs4.element.Tag
print("tag object type:",type(tag_object))

#If there is more than one Tag with the same name, the first element with that Tag name is called. 
#This corresponds to the most paid player:
tag_object=soup.h3
tag_object

#Enclosed in the bold attribute b, it helps to use the tree representation. 
#We can navigate down the tree using the child attribute to get the name.
#The Tag object is a tree of objects. We can access the child of the tag or navigate down the branch as follows:
tag_child =tag_object.b
tag_child

#You can access the parent with:
parent_tag=tag_child.parent
parent_tag

#tag_object parent is the body element
tag_object.parent

#tag_object sibling is the paragraph element
sibling_1=tag_object.next_sibling
sibling_1

#sibling_2 is the header element, which is also a sibling of both sibling_1 and tag_object
sibling_2=sibling_1.next_sibling
sibling_2
