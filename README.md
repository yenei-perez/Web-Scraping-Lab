# Web-Scraping-Lab
After this lab, you will be familiar with the basics of the BeautifulSoup Python library and you will be able to scrape webpages for data and filter the data.
For this lab, we are going to be using Python and several Python libraries.
Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files, we will focus on HTML files. This is accomplished by representing the HTML as a set of objects with methods used to parse the HTML. We can navigate the HTML as a tree, and/or filter out what we are looking for.

Code will teach you about Tags, Children, Parents and Siblings

CodePt2 will teach you about HTML Attributes & Navigable Strings

CodePt3 will teach you about Filters and Attributes

Lab will walk you through an exercise on downloading and scraping an actual webpage, piecing together the concepts we just learned
