HTML Attributes
#If the tag has attributes, the tag id="boldest" has an attribute id whose value is boldest. 
#You can access a tag’s attributes by treating the tag like a dictionary:
tag_child['id']

#You can access that dictionary directly as attrs:
tag_child.attrs

#We can also obtain the content of the attribute of the tag using the Python get() method.
tag_child.get('id')


Navigable Strings
#A string corresponds to a bit of text or content within a tag. 
#Beautiful Soup uses the NavigableString class to contain this text. 
#In our HTML we can obtain the name of the first player by extracting the string of the Tag object tag_child as follows:
tag_string=tag_child.string
tag_string

#We can verify the type is Navigable String
type(tag_string)

#A NavigableString is similar to a Python string or Unicode string. 
#To be more precise, the main difference is that it also supports some BeautifulSoup features. 
#We can convert it to string object in Python:
unicode_string = str(tag_string)
unicode_string
